# Smart Traffic Management System

A system to manage traffic at intersections by detecting vehicles and prioritizing emergency vehicles (like ambulances) using Raspberry Pi, FPGA, and computer vision.

## About the Project
This project solves traffic jams and helps emergency vehicles (like ambulances) pass intersections faster. It uses:
- A webcam to count vehicles with YOLO (a computer vision tool).
- A microphone to detect ambulance sirens with YAMNet.
- Raspberry Pi to process data.
- FPGA to control traffic lights in real-time.

We built and tested it on a small model of a traffic junction at Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (2025).

## Features
- Counts vehicles to adjust green light times for busy roads.
- Detects ambulance sirens and gives them priority (green light).
- Uses FPGA for fast and reliable traffic light control.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4, Basys 3 FPGA, Webcam, Microphone, LED Traffic Lights.
- **Software**: Python, Verilog, YOLOv8, YAMNet, OpenCV, PyAudio.
- **Tools**: Git, Vivado (for FPGA), TensorFlow Lite.

## How It Works
1. Webcam captures traffic and YOLO counts vehicles.
2. Microphone listens for sirens and YAMNet confirms if itâ€™s an ambulance.
3. Raspberry Pi processes the data and sends instructions to the FPGA.
4. FPGA changes traffic lights to reduce congestion or prioritize ambulances.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-Traffic-Management-System.git
   cd Smart-Traffic-Management-System
2. Install Python libraries
3. Add YOLO and YAMNet models to models/
4. Program the FPGA with src/verilog/fpga_blink_new.v using Vivado.
5. Run the main script
    python src/python/traffic_control.py

##Results

-Successfully controlled traffic lights based on vehicle count.
-Detected ambulances using siren sounds and video.
-Tested on a mini traffic junction model.
-Challenge: Audio processing was hard on Raspberry Pi, so we tested it separately on a laptop.
